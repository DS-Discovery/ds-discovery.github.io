## Common Qustions 

### Partners

   > - *Do I need to think about units/credits for the students?*
   >> Students need to have signed up with URAP credits. At a minimum, they should	be earning 2 units though if they are going above 6-8 hours a week, they can earn 3 units. 
   > - *Do I need to be prepared to provide grades or a report at the end of the semester or any other time during the semester?*
   >> We would like students to showcase their work progress at the end of the semester in a workshop. This is a Pass/No Pass program, so there is less pressure for an intensive evaluation program. We will be looking at a bi-monthly survey we will be sending along with an end of semester assessment to help determine whether students pass the class.
   > - *Is there a handbook or description of whatâ€™s expected of students in this program or is that determined collaboratively with the student?*
   >> Most of the expectations are determined by the project leaders collaboratively with each student. The baseline expectations that student fill out bimonthly surveys to indicate how work is progressing and an end of semester wrap up report.
   > - *What do I do when I select students?* 
   >> Please check out Timeline - Project Matching Tools for more detailed instructions.
   > - *Is there a limit on how many students I can select?*
   >> There is no limit on the number of students selected since students might opt for other projects. However, once the roster is finalized, we usually recommend not onboarding more than 5 students.
   > - *For the students that are not selected, do they have the option to join another project?*
   >> Students can initially apply to three projects. If they are rejected from their three top choices, they have option to be considered for one of the other 40 projects in the Discovery Program

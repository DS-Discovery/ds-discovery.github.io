## Expectations
   > * I commit to providing the student team(s) with a research question, domain expertise as well as established finals deliverables and goals.
   > * I will assign a knowledgeable mentor(s) for the project duration who will maintain regular communication with the student team and commit to meeting with them once a week for at least 30 mins.
   > * I will submit feedback on all the short surveys sent out by the Discovery Program to assess progress of projects.
   > * I commit to creating a safe, professional, inclusive and respectful environment for the student(s) I am working with.
   > * I will guide my team(s) towards a successful presentation of their work and research findings in the end-of-semester Discovery Showcase.

## Surveys
   > There will be 4 feedback surveys in total throughout the semester containing multiple choice and short answer questions. Please complete the feedbacks promptly as they give us a clearer sense of how we can assist you and your team.

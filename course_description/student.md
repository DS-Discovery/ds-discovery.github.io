## Expectations
   > * I acknowledge that I have been selected to become a research assistant for the duration of one semester with the expected workload of at least 6-10 hours per week.
   > * I commit to participating in only one Discovery project per semester.
   > * I will complete biweekly surveys this semester for progress tracking.
   > * I will submit a final research report, as part of a team, to present our findings and summarize the work my team and I have completed this semester.
   > * I, as part of my team, will present research findings in the semesterly Data Science Discovery Project Showcase.
   > * If requested by partner, I may be asked to digitally sign agreements to license intellectual property (IP) to partner, as well as an NDA. If unwilling to do so, I recognize that I will be reassigned to another project or asked to participate in Discovery in a future semester.  
   > * I acknowledge that I may be asked to sign a student agreement that outlines my role and responsibilities pertaining to my participation in the Data Science Discovery Program.
   > * I will take research unit(s) through URAP for their participation in DSDP and at the end of the semester be required to submit a learning report.
   > * Upon completion of the project, the I will provide to the partner any results, documentation and all materials associated with the project.


## Learning Objective

   > * Gain a practical understanding of how to responsibly apply data science methods to real-world problems
   > * Develop project management strategies to successfully deliver impactful data-driven research
   > * Articulate the social context within which a data science project exists
   > * Explore the ways that data science research can affect a multitude of stake holders  

## Surveys
   > There will be 4 feedback quizzes in total throughout the semester containing multiple choice and short answer questions. They will only be 'graded' based on completion. Please complete the feedback quizzes promptly as they give us a clearer sense of how we can assist you in your journey with Discovery, and failure to do so may result in NP for this class.

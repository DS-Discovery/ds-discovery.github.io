## Project Matching: 08/10/2020 - 09/04/2020
   > The matching phase takes place between 8/10 and 9/4. From 8/10 to 8/24 we will be collecting student applications and passing them on to Project Partners. On 8/24, the [student application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdo27PXKHHoTlq6NECz6Tah_JB3UBnPhPgUnLDTb9-zPmhRmQ/viewform) will close and Project Partners will have two weeks to wrap up interviews and finalize their student team.

> ### Project Matching Tools 
   > We have created some tools to help students find which project they are best suited for, and to help Project Partners decide which applicants are good fits. Please watch the accompanying video for more information. If project size shows as 0, it means that the partner(s) haven't specified their expected number of students. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us at ds-discovery@berkeley.edu.

## Modules: 09/04/2020 - 12/10/2020
   > Once teams are finalized, students will be asked to complete a series of assignments, attend live working group sessions and dig into asynchronous workshop materials. These resources will culminate in a final presentation to be submitted for the end-of-semester Showcase event. We will be posting assignment submissions on this website so we can all be inspired by what other projects are up to!

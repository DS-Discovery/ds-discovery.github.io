## Reduce service outages of BART
*Partner:Wendy Wheeler, BART (BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT)*

### Overview

Due to COVID, our operating budgets have been reduced. We need to use the vast amount of data gathered by our systems daily, and predict outages and prevent train delays and impacts to plant operations. Our data consists of traction power, fire life safety, train control, passenger information, and much more. If we could find a way to utilize our data more effectively, we could reduce our maintenance costs and provide improved train service to the entire Bay Area. BART would be able to do more with the limited funds available to handle system outages.

## Students

   > - *Do I need to apply to URAP in order to be eligible for Discovery?*
   >> No, you'll only need to complete the Discovery Application form. If you are accepted to one of the Discovery projects, we'll help you enroll in the URAP program to get credits.
   > - *Can I participate in multiple Discovery Projects?*
   >> No, we expect students to commit to only ONE project per semester.
   > - *What's the difference between the my first/second/third choices of projects?*
   >> The first/second/third choices you made will be taken into consideration as we calculate your matching score.
   > - *If I'm taking Data 8 this semester, would I still be eligible for the program?*
   >> Most of the projects that we have expect their candidates to have completed Data 8. Therefore, the completion of Data 8 is one of the prerequisites for our program.

## SF Chronicle Disaster Maps
*Partner: Evan Wagstaff,San Francisco Chronicle*

### Overview

"The San Francisco Chronicle has produced a well-known Fire Tracker for several years, using data from NOAA as well as NASA's MODIS and VIIRS-I satellites. We are also working on a Flood Tracker for the Houston Chronicle. 

In both projects, we believe the quality of the real-time data being delivered to our readers could be enhanced by additional data sources and custom processing."

## Advising 

### Peer Advisors
   > Peer Advisors complement the [Data Science Advising services](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/student-services) by sharing their diverse knowledge of and experiences with major courses, different Data Science Major domain emphases, extracurriculars and student groups on campus, research opportunities, and various campus resources.

### D-Lab Advisors

# Reduce service outages of BART
*Partner: Wendy Wheeler, BART (BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT), Government*

## Overview
### Project Description
Due to COVID, our operating budgets have been reduced. We need to use the vast amount of data gathered by our systems daily, and predict outages and prevent train delays and impacts to plant operations. Our data consists of traction power, fire life safety, train control, passenger information, and much more. If we could find a way to utilize our data more effectively, we could reduce our maintenance costs and provide improved train service to the entire Bay Area. BART would be able to do more with the limited funds available to handle system outages. 
### Expected Deliverable
Create actionable alerts for our maintenance teams, create additional Splunk dashboards for our Engineering and Maintenance partners, and figure out how to utilize our Oracle Analytics Cloud Platform. Any of these deliverables would help us out. 
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Provide useful, actionable data to our end users. Partner with our existing staff to move the needle on our machine learning and data analytics needs. 
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
We are looking for students that can think outside of the box to solve real world problems.

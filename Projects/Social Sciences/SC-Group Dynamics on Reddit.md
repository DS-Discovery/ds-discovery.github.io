# Group Dynamics on Reddit
*Partner: Daniel Stein, UC Berkeley, Academic*

## Overview
### Project Description
I downloaded 10 years of Reddit data (metadata and content). I am looking to clean the data and run some statistical models to examine what predicts group commitment (i.e., commitment to subreddit). The team would help me: 
1. Efficiently clean the massive dataset
1. Fit statistical models to test theoretically-derived predictions
1. Visualize the results. Expertise in NLP is a plus because we have the actual word content.
### Expected Deliverable
Cleaned dataset, fitted models, visualizations
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Interested undergraduates learn about the cycle of a social science research project and some preliminary results on the Reddit project 
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Interest in psychology research is a plus

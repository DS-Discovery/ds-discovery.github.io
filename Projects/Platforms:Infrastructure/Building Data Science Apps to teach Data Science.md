## Building Data Science Apps to teach Data Science
*Partner:Tim Hurt, Lawrence Hall of Science*

### Overview

The project goal will be to develop a number of digital applications designed to help people of all ages learn about different data science concepts, like statistics and ML algorithms, by providing learners with intuitive examples and interactions. These applications can then be used at the Lawrence Hall of Science to engage museum visitors in learning experience around data science and be incorporated into other Lawrence Hall of Science programs.

## System telemetry analysis
*Partner: Ian Smith, Powerside*

### Overview

Powerside wishes to develop value condition monitoring algorithms for high-value systems with generally high consequential costs of failure... industrial, medical, transportation, government, telecoms, for example. This requires setting up a modeling and operational model management framework within the AWS environment, and developing unsupervised and supervised models to anticipate and to isolate fault conditions on diverse data streams.  Particular emphasis is on making a system which can be seamlessly introduced into our fleet operations.

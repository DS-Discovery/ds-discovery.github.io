# Welcome!

Welcome to the fall 2020 semester of Data Science Discovery! This website contains information for both Project Partners and Student Researchers as you move through the recruitment process to the semester and ultimately towards the Discovery Showcase event. We will update this page periodically with project profiles and student interviews to get you inspired. 

Throughout the semester we will ask students to submit reflections on certain aspects of their projects, which we will post in the Projects section. Check in often to see what other projects are up to! For more information about resources and requirements for students, check out the Students page. Finally, we have listed our expectations for Project Partners in the Partner page.

We want to make sure that weâ€™re providing all the information you need to have a successful semester with Discovery. If you have any questions or comments, please contact ds-discovery@berkeley.edu.

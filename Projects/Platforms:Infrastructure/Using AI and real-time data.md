## Using AI and real-time data to power an early warning system for public safety and the recognition of emotions
*Partner:Dacher	Keltner, UC Berkeley*

### Overview

We will build an AI system to detect negative emotion from vocalizations recorded by body cameras warn by police (building upon several published papers in my lab) and develop a warning system for police officers, that informs them of when their emotions are escalating to risky or aggressive behavior

## Data

## Models

## Conclusion


```python

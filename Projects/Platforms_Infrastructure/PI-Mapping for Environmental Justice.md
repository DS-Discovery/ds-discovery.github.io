# Mapping for Environmental Justice
*Partner: Kelly Armijo, UC Berkeley, Non-Profit*

## Overview
### Project Description
Mapping for Environmental Justice (MEJ) creates easy-to-use, publicly-available maps that paint a holistic picture of intersecting environmental, social, and health impacts experienced by communities across the US. MEJ's maps combine environmental, public health, and socioeconomic data into a single indicator that reflects the combined impacts of race, poverty, and pollution that low-income communities, communities of color, and historically marginalized communities experience. Our maps are driven by an in-depth community input process that gives communities the power to dictate the data used to create the environmental justice indicator in their state.  This environmental justice indicator acts as a score for each census-tract that allows for an easy neighborhood-by-neighborhood comparison by policymakers, community members, advocates, and researchers. MEJ has created a demo map for Colorado, and is looking to improve our interactive map and website, and also expand our map to other states.
### Expected Deliverable
We hope to see an improved website and map for Colorado, either using our existing framework or a new one, and potentially a new map for an additional state identified by our team that would utilize existing datasets and incorporate new datasets.
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
A successful semester would would end with a beautiful interactive map and website that a wide range of stakeholders find easy to use. If we expand our map to an additional state, our website would host both a map for Colorado and the new state in an intuitive, easy to use manner. The semester would also include regular communication with students so that they feel like they're a part of the team and are able to gain a deeper understanding of environmental justice, the role that data can play in policymaking, and the importance of grounding environmental justice data in communitiesâ€™ lived experiences.
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Prior experience working in environmental justice and community outreach is useful, although not required.

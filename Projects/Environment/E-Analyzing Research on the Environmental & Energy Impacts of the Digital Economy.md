## Mapping for Environmental Justice
*Partner:Cait Cady,Berkeley Law Center for Law, Energy & the Environment*

### Overview

This project will center around analyzing a database of sources for an emerging multidisciplinary field of practice in hopes of gaining helpful insight into the fieldâ€™s major trends, focus areas, and trajectory. The bibliographic database consists of 200-300 sources (journals, books, blogs, etc.) related to the environmental impacts of the digital economy. While there is a considerable amount of scholarship focused on the digital economy generally, there continues to be a significant gap in our knowledge of the environmental and energy dimension. Our team, in partnership with the Yale School of the Environment and the Environmental Law Institute, is seeking a better understanding of the current landscape to inform our support of future research endeavors.

## Visualizing Women in Tech Data at UC
*Partner: Jill	Finlayson, WITI@UC, CITRIS and COE*

### Overview

As part of continuing research in to the state of women in tech, WITI@UC, would like to enlist students to visualize data from CalAnswers and UCOP to show percentages and changes over time in the participation of women in tech fields, and specifically the participation and persistence of women on the Berkeley campus in various STEM majors. Research will look at intersectionality and potential opportunities for effective interventions to retain diverse talent in STEM majors. Participants will help define the research questions and will be FERPA trained to leverage more detailed data sets.

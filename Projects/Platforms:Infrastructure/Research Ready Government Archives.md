## Research Ready Government Archives
*Partner: Nick Adams, Goodly Labs*

### Overview

The Research Ready project seeks two students to help improve and maintain archives of government activity that researchers, journalists, and the public can easily query. The project team has already scraped the web for document files while retaining document metadata; identified and extracted meaningful data objects within the documents; linked those objects to external databases; prepared all this compiled textual data for computational analysis in R and Python; and partnered with the Social Science Research Council to host their newly formed database so that the public and other researchers can launch their own studies of the data. Now, we need people with text analysis and data visualization skills to help us improve this data and visualize it for the public and researchers.

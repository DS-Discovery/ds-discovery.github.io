# SF Chronicle Disaster Maps
*Partner: Evan Wagstaff,San Francisco Chronicle, Industry*

## Overview
### Project Description
The San Francisco Chronicle has produced a well-known Fire Tracker for several years, using data from NOAA as well as NASA's MODIS and VIIRS-I satellites. We are also working on a Flood Tracker for the Houston Chronicle. 

In both projects, we believe the quality of the real-time data being delivered to our readers could be enhanced by additional data sources and custom processing.
### Expected Deliverable
An ideal deliverable would be a live-updating layer or feed depicting real-time fire conditions (in California) or flood levels (in Texas).
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
We would be interested to work with a team of students, showing them how we currently process data and discussing what we'd like to display. They would be able to investigate available products and create a system to ingest data and output a layer or feed that we can use on our maps.

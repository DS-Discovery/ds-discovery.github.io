## Wordnik Etymology Search
*Partner:Erin McKean, Wordnik Society*

### Overview

In this project, we hope to build an etymology search tool and API for Wordnik users. We'll digitize an out-of-copyright etymological dictionary and pull data from Wiktionary, and create an appropriate datastore. We'll experiment with ways to use classifiers to connect words to etymons. Users of the tool will be able to find groups of words that are etymologically related, including words that share languages of origin or intermediate forms.

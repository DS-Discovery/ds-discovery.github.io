# Visualizing Women in Tech Data at UC
*Partner: Jill Finlayson, WITI@UC, CITRIS and COE, Academic*

## Overview
### Project Description
As part of continuing research in to the state of women in tech, WITI@UC, would like to enlist students to visualize data from CalAnswers and UCOP to show percentages and changes over time in the participation of women in tech fields, and specifically the participation and persistence of women on the Berkeley campus in various STEM majors. Research will look at intersectionality and potential opportunities for effective interventions to retain diverse talent in STEM majors. Participants will help define the research questions and will be FERPA trained to leverage more detailed data sets. 
### Expected Deliverable
We would like to be able to share this information with Deans and Faculty in presentations distilling key learnings and opportunities. The data should be presented in clear and consistent graphs and compelling visualizations showing trends over time.
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Clearly articulated hypothesis, research questions, rigorous methodology, and distilled findings that clearly communicate actionable insights.
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Communication, presentation, and experience creating effective decks a bonus.

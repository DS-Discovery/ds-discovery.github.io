## Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education: An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions
*Partner:Rosalie Z. Fanshel, UC Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management*

### Overview

"In the last decade, many U.S. “land-grant” agricultural universities (including UC Berkeley) have turned a reflexive lens on the fact that their institutions marginalize certain community members. These schools have begun to ask how inequities within their food and agriculture education perpetuate food systems injustices in the U.S. more broadly. This research project critically evaluates these nascent institutional efforts by examining how agriculture schools use pedagogical practices to improve equity and inclusion outcomes. Coursework descriptions offer a key insight into the pedagogical methods and types of food systems topics in use at land-grant universities. This project aims to create the first comprehensive database of coursework content at all land-grant institutions. This database will be the first effort in the U.S. to 1) track all recent food and agriculture classes across the land-grant system, and 2) specifically identify pedagogical methods and food justice content. Through content analysis of land-grant university coursework this project seeks to answer the following questions: 
 * Which land-grant universities—and how many—currently offer courses that 1) utilize critical pedagogical methods, and/or 2) explicitly discuss food systems equity as part of their curriculum?
 * What are the characteristics of the critical, equity-oriented food systems curriculum at land-grant universities? "

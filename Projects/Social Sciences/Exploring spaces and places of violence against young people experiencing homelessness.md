### Overview

The study interviewed young people experiencing homelessness and accessed administrative data, and those data have been used to construct geospatial analyses of sites and pathways of violence. The goal of the study is to inform policy and practice interventions and reform to reduce violence against young people experiencing homelessness. The current, active goal is to create dissemination and visualization products from the data to present findings to stakeholders and public officials.

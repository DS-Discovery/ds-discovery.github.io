# System telemetry analysis
*Partner: Ian Smith, Powerside, Industry*

## Overview
### Project Description
Powerside wishes to develop value condition monitoring algorithms for high-value systems with generally high consequential costs of failure... industrial, medical, transportation, government, telecoms, for example. This requires setting up a modeling and operational model management framework within the AWS environment, and developing unsupervised and supervised models to anticipate and to isolate fault conditions on diverse data streams.  Particular emphasis is on making a system which can be seamlessly introduced into our fleet operations.
### Expected Deliverable
Models, modelling and model management framework.
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Models live and running on customer data.
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Familiarity with AWS ecosystem.

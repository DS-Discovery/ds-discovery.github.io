## Mapping for Environmental Justice
*Partner:Kelly Armijo, UC Berkeley*

### Overview

Mapping for Environmental Justice (MEJ) creates easy-to-use, publicly-available maps that paint a holistic picture of intersecting environmental, social, and health impacts experienced by communities across the US. MEJ's maps combine environmental, public health, and socioeconomic data into a single indicator that reflects the combined impacts of race, poverty, and pollution that low-income communities, communities of color, and historically marginalized communities experience. Our maps are driven by an in-depth community input process that gives communities the power to dictate the data used to create the environmental justice indicator in their state.  This environmental justice indicator acts as a score for each census-tract that allows for an easy neighborhood-by-neighborhood comparison by policymakers, community members, advocates, and researchers. MEJ has created a demo map for Colorado, and is looking to improve our interactive map and website, and also expand our map to other states.

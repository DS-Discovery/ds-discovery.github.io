## Efficient fund allocation for NGOs
*Partner: Cara Arellano, DaanMatch*

### Overview

"DaanMatch is a project to address social inequalities in fund distribution in India. Recent data shows that around 60% of organizing funding is allocated to projects in urban areas and that the most benefited are a few multinationals NGOs. But around 70% of NGOs registered in India are community-driven and operate in rural areas, which means a big amount of data and points of action that could spread social impact widely throughout the country.  

How can we use data science techniques to transform the information that is currently distributed across heterogeneous data silos into a Pan India tool to aid decision making in this time of crisis?"

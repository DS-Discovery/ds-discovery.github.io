## AI Content Management System for The Tempest Media 
*Partner:Farwa Farshori, The Tempest Media*

### Overview

"The Tempest is a digital publishing platform that has published hundreds of articles over the past 5 years. This project will focus on building a machine learning model that examines social media trends and suggests which pieces of content to repost. The aim is to find the most relevant content for trending topics, resurface the content and determine the optimal times in the day to post each content. 

The Tempest is a global media publisher, with an emphasis on personal narratives. The challenge will be not only repurposing content that is popular with Trends in the USA but also Canada, the UK, the UAE, South Asia and Brazil.

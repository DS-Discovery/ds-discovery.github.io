## Sumerian Networks
*Partner:Adam Anderson, UC Berkeley: DH / D-Lab / BIDS*

### Overview

"The goal of the Sumerian Network project has been to build reproducible socio-economic networks from the Ur III textual archives. We applied novel computational methods for name disambiguation, and in the absence of 'gold-standard' data, we built an atomized network based on name instances in textual attestations for c. 15,000 documents. This research project has brought together archaeologists, cuneiform specialists, experts in Computational Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing from around the world. Current results for reproducible network models are available in Jupyter Notebooks [https://github.com/niekveldhuis/Sumerian-network] and Gephi Networks [https://github.com/admndrsn/Gephi].

## Evaluating Alameda County CO2 Emissions and Optimizing Customer Programs Using Marginal Emissions Data 
*Partner:Kevin Li, East Bay Community Energy*

### Overview

East Bay Community Energyâ€™s goal is to provide cleaner and cheaper energy to East Bay Cities and customers. The goal of this project is to answer the following questions: 1.        Compare CO2 accounting methods between a locational/market-based approach versus a marginal approach for EBCE electricity load 2. Optimize electric vehicle (EV) and demand response (DR) schedules to minimize emissions and energy costs 3. Evaluate whether more accurate energy demand forecasts lower CO2 emissions.

# Building Data Science Apps to teach Data Science
*Partner: Tim Hurt, Lawrence Hall of Science, Non-Profit*
## Overview
### Project Description
The project goal will be to develop a number of digital applications designed to help people of all ages learn about different data science concepts, like statistics and ML algorithms, by providing learners with intuitive examples and interactions. These applications can then be used at the Lawrence Hall of Science to engage museum visitors in learning experience around data science and be incorporated into other Lawrence Hall of Science programs.
### Expected Deliverable
Multiple web applications that are well documented and robust
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Having multiple web applications that can be tested with users and well designed enough that my team can modify them as needed. Perhaps more importantly, I would want the students to have enjoyed and learned from the project.
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Familiarity with AWS or other cloud service providers, comfort with Github.

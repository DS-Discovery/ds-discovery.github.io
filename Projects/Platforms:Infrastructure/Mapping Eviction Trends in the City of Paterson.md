## Mapping Eviction Trends in the City of Paterson 
*Partner:Harsha Mallajosyula, City of Paterson*

### Overview

"With unemployment rate at its historic highs and moratoriums on eviction expiring across the United States, tens of thousands of renters are expected to face homelessness. Evictions have a devastating impact on families, communities and the health of cities, and could further exacerbate problems of homelessness, crime and poverty. 

The City of Paterson wants to develop a dashboard that would map and visualize eviction trends in the City’s neighbourhoods using data scraped from Twitter by identifying different categories of hashtags related to eviction. The City aims to achieve two goals through this project (1) provide a spatial analysis of eviction trends to help organizations prioritize allocation of resources & address increased community needs and (2) develop insights and predict future trends in evictions and homelessness in the City’s neighborhood.

## Building Integrated Solar Photovoltaics Assessment via ML
*Partner: Sergio Castellanos, UC Berkeley*

### Overview

With the advent of novel image classification algorithms, the opportunities to apply them to the energy space are increasing, too. In this project, we are looking to expand these capabilities into an ongoing task of assessing the potential of building integrated solar photovoltaics through ML image classification. You'd be given a (limited) dataset, with the opportunity to expand it beyond and implement different algorithms. Beyond that, you'd also venture into the energy space by modeling the operation of PV systems and link both the ML field with the energy space.

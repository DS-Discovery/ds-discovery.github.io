# Demo Watch
*Partner: Nick Adams, Goodly Labs, Non-Profit & Academic*

## Overview
### Project Description
The Demo Watch project has collected and is curating over 8,000 news articles describing all the interactions between police and protesters during the Occupy movement. This semester, students will work with senior researchers and professors from Goodly Labs, NYU, and the Univ. of Michigan to 
>1) implement/code a multi-level time-series model that will analyze curated Demo Watch data to find patterns of peaceful and violent activity 
>2) create a text classifier, via supervised machine learning, that is capable of scanning through news articles about protest to identify important data for analysis.

### Expected Deliverable
Building multi-level, time series models of police, protester, & city government interaction. And building text classifiers via supervised ML.

### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Ideally, the semester will end with (1) a Jupyter notebook that intakes Demo Watch data and outputs data-enriched models of police/protester interaction and (2) a Jupyter notebook that intakes Demo Watch data and creates a text classifier via supervised ML. 

### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
We'd like one student (grad or undergrad) to help with project management

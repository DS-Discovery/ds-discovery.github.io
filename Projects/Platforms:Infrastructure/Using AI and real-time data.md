## Using AI and real-time data to power an early warning system for public safety and the recognition of emotions
*Partner: Dacher	Keltner, UC Berkeley, Academic*

## Overview
### Project Description
We will build an AI system to detect negative emotion from vocalizations recorded by body cameras warn by police (building upon several published papers in my lab) and develop a warning system for police officers, that informs them of when their emotions are escalating to risky or aggressive behavior.
### Expected Deliverable
A Machine Learning algorithm for detecting emotion in the voice from police body cameras.  The beginning frame for developing an app that provides emotion specific feedback.
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
Build data base, train Machine Learning on that data base for successful classification.

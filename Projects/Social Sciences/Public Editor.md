## Public Editor
*Partner: Nick Adams, Goodly Labs*

### Overview

Students on this project will analyze data from a collaborative web app guiding thousands of internet volunteers to read through the most shared news articles of the day and label evidence of misinformation in the content. Working alongside a national coalition of social science researchers and journalists, a Nobel Laureate, cognitive scientists, and software designers/developers, students will test the robustness of the Public Editor system, fortify it against attacks by trolls, and implement gamification features to ensure volunteers enjoy their experience.

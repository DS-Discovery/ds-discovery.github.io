# Public Editor
*Partner: Nick Adams, Goodly Labs, Non-Profit & Academic*

## Overview
### Project Description
Students on this project will analyze data from a collaborative web app guiding thousands of internet volunteers to read through the most shared news articles of the day and label evidence of misinformation in the content. Working alongside a national coalition of social science researchers and journalists, a Nobel Laureate, cognitive scientists, and software designers/developers, students will test the robustness of the Public Editor system, fortify it against attacks by trolls, and implement gamification features to ensure volunteers enjoy their experience.  
### Expected Deliverable
Students will create (1) a Jupyter notebook performing validation studies on the system to ensure the accuracy and reliability of users' labels; (2) Red Team scenarios and solutions to those scenarios, and (3) a codebase for automatically updating users' badges, points, and leaderboard status based upon their activity data.
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
A successful semester will result in the satisfactory completion of the deliverables above.
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Familiarity for eagerness to learn AWS cloud computing services including Lambda.

# AI Content Management System for The Tempest Media 
*Partner: Farwa Farshori, The Tempest Media, Industry*

## Overview
### Project Description
The Tempest is a digital publishing platform that has published hundreds of articles over the past 5 years. This project will focus on building a machine learning model that examines social media trends and suggests which pieces of content to repost. The aim is to find the most relevant content for trending topics, resurface the content and determine the optimal times in the day to post each content. 

The Tempest is a global media publisher, with an emphasis on personal narratives. The challenge will be not only repurposing content that is popular with Trends in the USA but also Canada, the UK, the UAE, South Asia and Brazil. 
### Expected Deliverable
We would love to have a working model from the Discovery Student team. 
### What would a successful semester look like to you?
A successful semester would entail the completion of a minimum of one phase of the project. This project can be broken up into phases.  
- Phase 1: Weâ€™d have an AI model that can examine social media trends and find articles from our depository that could be repurposed 
- Phase 2: The AI model would be able to repost the article automatically by determining the optimal time to post each content 
- Phase 3: The AI model would reconfigure the title of the content to match trending topics and garner views. 
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
We are looking for students that can think outside of the box to solve real world problems.

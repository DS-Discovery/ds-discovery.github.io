## Advising

### Peer Advisors
   > Peer Advisors complement the [Data Science Advising services](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/student-services) by sharing their diverse knowledge of and experiences with major courses, different Data Science Major domain emphases, extracurriculars and student groups on campus, research opportunities, and various campus resources.

### D-Lab Advisors
   > [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) offers consulting services on research design, data analysis, data management, and related techniques and technologies. We welcome inquiries from Berkeley faculty, staff, postdocs, and grad students at all levels of expertise. Our standard consulting services are free of charge. In general, we provide consulting for you at your research stage, NOT for coursework. Please use your TAs for support specific to individual classes or assignments.  

### Technical Resources
  > We currently have a DS-Discovery Github organization, which gives us access to the [Github Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/organizing-members-into-teams) infrastructure. This offers version control, source code management and allows you to manage permissions on project code access, enhancing flexibility in development. For code-intensive and/or multi-semester projects, we especially recommend the use of Github, since it allows the team to collaborate easily, makes it easier to onboard new researchers if they change from semester to semester, and also helps our peer consultants to easily debug code. If you would like to create a Github team, please email [ds-discovery@berkeley.edu](mailto:ds-discovery@berkeley.edu), with title of your project and Github usernames of your researchers, with the subject line “Github Team Setup”.

# Exploring spaces and places of violence against young people experiencing homelessness
*Partner: Allen Ratliff, Innovations for Youth-School of Public Health, Academic*

## Overview
### Project Description
The study interviewed young people experiencing homelessness and accessed administrative data, and those data have been used to construct geospatial analyses of sites and pathways of violence. The goal of the study is to inform policy and practice interventions and reform to reduce violence against young people experiencing homelessness. The current, active goal is to create dissemination and visualization products from the data to present findings to stakeholders and public officials.
### Expected Deliverable
Data visualizations of geospatial and other/administrative data

### What would a successful semester look like to you?
High quality, professional images, graphs, maps, and other forms of data dissemination that can be presented to the public and stakeholders
### Additional Skills from ideal candidates
Student researchers will be expected to have some familiarity (personal, academic, professional, volunteer/service, etc.) with homelessness, systemic violence, and/or poverty, 
and should be sure to include a short description of that background in their application

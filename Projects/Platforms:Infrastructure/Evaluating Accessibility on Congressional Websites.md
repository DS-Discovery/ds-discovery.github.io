## Evaluating Accessibility on Congressional Websites
*Partner:Emma Lurie, School of Information, UC Berkeley*

### Overview

Voters and constituents increasingly look to the websites of elected officials to answer their questions about voting or constituent services. Recent work has discovered that many of the leading presidential candidates’ websites are not accessible to vision impaired users. This project aims to discover the breadth and depth of accessibility issues on congressional representatives’ websites. Discovery students will be responsible for developing a data collection framework using existing accessibility APIs and then analyzing the accessibility of congressional and election websites using primarily descriptive statistics. The final deliverables of the project will be a written report and accessible web application.

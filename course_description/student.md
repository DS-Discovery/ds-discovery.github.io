## Surveys
   > There will be 4 feedback quizzes in total throughout the semester containing multiple choice and short answer questions. They will only be 'graded' based on completion. Please complete the feedback quizzes promptly as they give us a clearer sense of how we can assist you in your journey with Discovery, and failure to do so may result in NP for this class.
